This post is for Heartstone Arena players who enjoy thinking about drafting. And by thinking, I mean taking five minutes to decide between Tol'vir Stonshaper and Blizzard on the very first pick.
Sounds tedious doesn't it? That's why I've done some thinking for you!

That first example will demonstrate to you the reason drafting theory is valuable.

Between Tol'vir Stoneshaper, Blizzard, and Hungry Crab, which card would you pick? Most people would pick Blizzard. If you use Hearth Arena you would definitely pick Blizzard.
That draft I chose Tol'vir Stoneshaper for my first pick after careful consideration. That doesn't mean it's the "right" pick. You can never tell what cards the draft will offer later.
But what that pick did do was fit my **deck plan**, and eliminate certain **drafting risks**. I have no doubt that this decision aided me in making this a 12 win deck.

**common drafting mistakes**

**deck plan**

**situational vs consistent**

**slow vs fast** (proactive vs reactive)

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
