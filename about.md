Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling<br/>
From glen to glen and down the mountain side<br/>
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling<br/>
It's you, It's you, must go, and I must bide<br/>

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow<br/>
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow<br/>
I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow<br/>
Oh Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so<br/>

But if you come, and all the flowers are dying<br/>
And I am dead, as dead I well may be<br/>
You'll come and find the place where I am lying<br/>
And kneel and say an "Ave" there for me<br/>

And I will know, tho' soft ye tread above me<br/>
And then my grave will richer, sweeter be<br/>
And you'll bend down and tell me that you love me<br/>
And I will rest in peace until you come to me<br/>
